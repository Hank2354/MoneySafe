## About project :warning:

This pet-project aims to help control expenses by setting the necessary budgets for categories.

In order to achieve maximum efficiency, it is necessary that the process of entering transactions into the application becomes a habit.

Minimalistic style, and intuitive interface help you quickly get used to and make all transactions in the application in a short time

### Main block
 
There are two buttons on the main screen for quickly adding income or expense. The user will perform these operations frequently, so the buttons are hard to miss.

Also, from this screen we can go to one of the main modules
- Analytics
- All transactions
- Settings

### Analytics block :bar_chart:

On this screen, we can see a brief summary of our transactions, see how our income or expenses are distributed, and you can also see how much we spent from the total planned budget for the month.

Charts and progress bar were used to display statistics
